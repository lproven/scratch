# Scratch

This a a space for me to play around with Docbook & Oxygen.

# Project Title

It's a scratch workspace. There's nothing much to describe because there is nothing important here.

## Getting Started

It's a repo on Github. Configure a Github account, install and configure Git. Clone it, edit the files. Add them, commit them, push them back. That is about it.

### Prerequisites

Since it's not really software, there aren't many pre-requisities.

```
Git
A Github account
A text editor, such as Xed from the Mint X-Apps.
A tool to compile Docbook into something more readable, such as Publican or DAPS.
```

### Installing

What is to install? These are text files, not code.

```
Choose a text editor you like and can work with.
This should be something friendly and powerful. Or, alternatively, Vi or Emacs.
```

If you don't want to muck around with Git, you could just use a web browser and download it.

## Running the tests

There are no tests. Can you read it? Yes. Good, you're done.
Can you read? No? We suggest you try 9gag or Imgur then.

### Break down into end to end tests

English, motherfreaker. Do you speak it?

```
Jules from "Pulp Fiction". He's a good example, and he's not even real.
```

### And coding style tests

The Readme is in Markdown. The rest is in Docbook, which is a kind of XML. Don't ask. If you don't know, you won't like it.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?oxygen RNGSchema="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/5.0/rng/docbook.rng" type="xml"?>
<article xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
    xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="5.0">
    <info>
        <title>Article Template Title</title>
        <author>
            <orgname>Organization Name</orgname>
            <address>
                <city>City</city>
                <street>Street</street>
                <postcode>000000</postcode>
                <country>Country</country>
            </address>
            <email>user@example.com</email>
        </author>
    </info>
    <sect1>
        <title>Section1 Title</title>
        <subtitle>Section1 Subtitle</subtitle>
        <para>Text</para>
    </sect1>
</article>
```

I told you you wouldn't like it.

## Deployment

Best not, eh?

## Built With

* [Xed](https://github.com/linuxmint/xed) - A simple-ish text editor with actual menus.
* [oXygen/](https://www.oxygenxml.com/) - A semi-WYSIWYG XML editor.
* [DAPS](https://opensuse.github.io/daps/) - Used to ``compile'' Docbook to PDF & other formats.
* [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) -- online Markdown editor. Nifty.

## Contributing

You probably can't, but cash donations or winning lottery tickets are welcome.

## Versioning

Version 0.01 - Replace Github's near-empty file with some boilerplate text.

Version 0.02 - Fix: replace "Githib" with actual website name. Test Dillinger editor.

Version 0.03 - Fix errors, typos & layout introduced with Dillinger. You know how it is.

Version 0.04 - This is actually turning into a real revision history. Well I never.
